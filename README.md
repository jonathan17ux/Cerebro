## Why Cerebro?

Most AI assistants are a single chat window that forgets everything between sessions. Cerebro is a self-hosted alternative that gives you a **team of experts** (specialized AI agents) — each with persistent memory, tool access, and the ability to execute multi-step workflows — running entirely on your machine.

|  | Traditional AI assistants | Cerebro |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Single general-purpose assistant | Team of specialized experts with defined roles |
| **Memory** | Conversation-scoped, resets often | Persistent 3-tier memory scoped per user, expert, and routine |
| **Execution** | Answers and advice only | Plans, acts, and runs multi-step routines across tools |
| **Trust** | Black box | Approval gates, live execution logs, full activity history |
| **Data** | Cloud-hosted | Local-first — SQLite, on your machine, your data stays yours |

<!-- Screenshots and demo video coming soon -->

## Features

### Specialized AI Agents

Create domain-specific experts — Executive Assistant, Personal CFO, Fitness Coach, Research Analyst — each with their own memory, model selection, and tool access. Select an expert in the chat tray, or let Cerebro route automatically. Need a new specialist? Describe it in plain English and Cerebro will vibe-engineer one for you: propose, preview, install.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Compose teams of agents with a coordinator, role-based delegation, and sequential or parallel execution strategies. Example: a "Meeting Ops" team where Researcher pulls context, Analyst extracts action items, Writer drafts follow-ups, and Reviewer checks tone — all in one coordinated run.

### Workflow Automation from Chat

When Cerebro detects repeatable work, it proposes saving it as a reusable routine — a directed graph of steps compiled from plain English. Preview runs through the real execution engine with live streaming logs. Trigger routines on a cron schedule, via webhook, or manually.

### Autonomous Tasks

Give Cerebro a goal — a spec, an app, a research brief — and it will decompose it into phases, assign experts, execute each step, and deliver the result. Tasks support clarification questions before execution, live console output, workspace file browsing, and a final deliverable view.

### Trust by Design

Approval gates pause execution before sensitive actions (sending emails, editing calendars). Every run streams live logs to the UI and writes a complete record to Activity. Drill into any run to see step-by-step execution, timestamps, inputs, outputs, and errors.

### Long-Term Memory

Three-tier scoped memory that grows with you: **context files** (your profile, communication style, project notes), **learned facts** (auto-extracted from conversations), and **knowledge entries** (structured domain records like workouts, expenses, meetings). Memory is scoped per user, per expert, and per routine — fully viewable and editable in Settings.

### Local-First and Private

Runs entirely on your machine. SQLite database, local file system, OS keychain for credentials. Run local GGUF models for complete offline operation, or connect cloud providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google) when you want them. Your data never leaves your device unless you choose to.

### Voice Interface

Voice call mode with any expert. Local speech-to-text via faster-whisper and text-to-speech via Kokoro ONNX — no cloud transcription required. Waveform visualization, live transcript, and subtitles built in.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **Python** >= 3.11
- **Git**
- **(macOS)** Xcode Command Line Tools — required for native modules (`node-pty`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AgenticFirst/Cerebro.git
cd Cerebro

# Set up the Python backend
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..

# Install frontend dependencies
# (postinstall automatically downloads voice models ~340 MB)
npm install

# Start the app
npm start
```

On first launch, head to **Integrations** to add an API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google) or download a local model to start chatting.
